      <p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC), in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), revealed a stark number of youth currently using any tobacco product in their <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/youth-and-tobacco/results-annual-national-youth-tobacco-survey#2023%20Findings%20on%20Youth%20Tobacco%20Use"> 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey.</a> Among the millions of students polled across the country, nearly 8% of students (2.13 million) reported current and consistent use of e-cigarettes.</p>

        <p>Originally designed as a sleek alternative for adults quitting cigarettes, today’s popular vaping devices resemble brightly-colored toys and house as much fruit-flavored nicotine as 590 cigarettes. According to the survey, almost 9 out of 10 youth use flavored e-cigarettes daily. While tobacco usage decreased among high school students by around four percent, numbers are on the rise for sixth graders and the like. E-cigarettes—with popular brands such as Elf Bars, Vuses, Breezes, and Esco Bars—remain the most popular product for the tenth year in a row.

            <p>The ease at which minors can access and purchase tobacco products lies partly in retail vendors’ unregulated synthetic nicotine, spearheading a growing market of candy and fruit-flavored vapes. These efforts circumvent the FDA’s 2019 crack down on marketing authorization, and companies such as the teen-favorite Puff Bar colorfully line retail vendors with flavors and products that don’t fall under FDA oversight—pulling at youth addiction and allowing kids as young as 12 years old to purchase dangerous and largely unregulated products.

                <p>Lilah Brown, a 13-year-old from Michigan who began vaping a year ago, attends a middle school where vapes are hidden in tampon boxes and bathroom ceiling tiles; local high schoolers form makeshift ‘businesses’ where Brown and others can purchase these products. In a conversation with her mother, Angela, she said her daughter would use money saved up from holidays and birthdays to buy them.

<p>“[Big tobacco] is marketing and selling to a younger age group,” Brown said. “They’re making it seem like it’s freaking candy. [The vapes] are bubble gum or cherry flavored, the colors are pastel, just like you would see in their toys they used to play with a year or two ago.”
</p>
<p>While many states require licenses for over-the-counter sales, such as New York, vendors consistently sell to minors. In 
  <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Legislation/Table-of-States-with-Laws-Requiring-Licenses-For-O/exds-h9fr/about_data">data</a> provided by the New York State Department of Health, vendors in five counties across the state rated highest in selling restricted products to minors. Measuring from 2019 to 2020, Albany County sold nearly 2,000 products to minors and were only fined or penalized for ten of those sales. </p>

<p>Perhaps tobacco companies are capitalizing on an impressionable demographic, in which young children like Lilah turn to these substances to mitigate the stress of life at a young age. While some of the health risks of the addictive drug have been studied, such as altering brain pathways responsible for memory, sound decision-making and self-control, there isn’t nearly enough detail for vaping as there was for the cigarette epidemic. </p>
<p>Despite this, FDA’s longest-running
  <a href="https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/public-health-education-campaigns/real-cost-campaign">campaign,</a>
  “The Real Cost,” attempts to educate young nicotine users on the negative health effects and risks of vaping and smoking, based on extensive research and modern marketing tactics. Brown herself has seen these advertisements, and in the 2021 National Youth Tobacco Survey 75.7% reported exposure to these marketing messages.</p>
<p>But do children care?</p>
<p>The Gen-Z renaissance of wielding key lime pie-flavored Elf Bars in school cafeterias, on the street, during DJ sets remains powerful. The grip of temporary solace, a buzz, and the ease of attaining flavored vapes perhaps overpowers any attempt at public health education.</p>
<p>"These kids are impressionable, they are easily trusting, and they are seeing it constantly," Brown said.</p>
